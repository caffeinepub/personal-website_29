  "summary": "The diff shows modifications to backend/main.mo and updates to frontend file summaries and project state, but does not provide concrete evidence of investigation or fixes for the site loading issue. The BuildRequest requires identifying the root cause through browser console inspection, fixing critical errors, verifying routes, and ensuring backend/auth initialization—none of which are documented in the provided diff.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-38",
      "requirement": "Investigate why the website fails to load and identify the root cause of the loading error (browser console errors, network failures, JavaScript exceptions, routing issues, or backend connection problems)",
      "reason": "No documentation, investigation notes, console error logs, or root cause analysis provided in the diff. The acceptance criteria require identifying and documenting the specific point of failure through browser console inspection, but no such evidence exists.",
