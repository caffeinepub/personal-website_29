  "summary": "The diff successfully implements both requirements. REQ-22 and REQ-23 are fulfilled: a gold and silver hexagonal background pattern has been added to both the home page (HomePage.tsx) and the product management admin page (AdminDashboard.tsx) via the 'hexagonal-pattern' CSS class defined in index.css. The pattern uses SVG with gold (#D4AF37) and silver (#C0C0C0) colors with appropriate opacity levels, maintains the warm earth-tone color scheme, and is applied as a background that covers the entire page without interfering with existing content.",
