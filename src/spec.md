# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Investigate and fix the critical site loading issue preventing the website from opening.

**Planned changes:**
- Identify root cause of loading failure through browser console inspection and error analysis
- Fix all critical errors preventing initial page load (JavaScript errors, network failures, routing issues, backend connection problems)
- Verify all application routes load correctly after fixing the issue
- Ensure backend actor initialization and Internet Identity authentication work properly

**User-visible outcome:** The website loads successfully at the deployment URL, displaying the homepage with all sections (Header, Hero, Products, Footer) rendering correctly. Users can navigate between pages and access authenticated features without errors.
