## Summary
**Goal:** Build a multi-platform shopping product index with search functionality across Amazon, Flipkart, Meesho, BlinkIt, and other platforms.

**Planned changes:**
- Create backend data model to store product information (name, price, description, image URL, category, platform source, product URL)
- Implement backend functions to add products from Amazon, Flipkart, Meesho, BlinkIt, and other platforms
- Implement backend search functionality to query products by name, category, or platform filter
- Create a Products page displaying indexed products in a grid layout with product cards
- Add search bar component with platform filtering to the Products page
- Update navigation header to include Products link
- Update Hero section to reflect the multi-platform shopping index functionality

**User-visible outcome:** Users can browse and search products indexed from multiple shopping platforms (Amazon, Flipkart, Meesho, BlinkIt, and others) on a dedicated Products page, filter by platform, and click through to view products on their original platforms.
